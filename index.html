            <h3 id="headline">Penrose Timeline:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - Born in Colchester, England.</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - He was awarded first class degree in mathematics from University of London.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1955</strong> - Reintroduced the E. H. Moore generalised matrix inverse,
                    also known as the "<u>Mooreâ€“Penrose inverse.</u>"</li>
                <li><strong>1958</strong> - Roger and his father published article in British Journal of Psychology,
                    about impossible figures, popularly known as "<u>Penrose triangle</u>"
                    and "<u>Penrose staircase.</u>"</li>
                <li><strong>1958</strong> - Finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge,
                    with a thesis on "tensor methods in algebraic geometry".</li>
                <li><strong>1959</strong> - He married Joan Isabel Wedge.</li>
                <li><strong>1971</strong> - Developed a method of mapping the regions of space-time surrounding
                    a black hole. Such a map, which is called a "<u>Penrose diagram</u>", allows one to
                    visualize the effects of gravitation upon an entity approaching a black hole.</li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong> - Discovered "<u>Penrose tiling</u>", in which a set of shapes can be used
                    to
                    cover a plane without using a repeating pattern.</li>
                <li><strong>1994</strong> - Was knighted for services to science.</li>
                <li><strong>2004</strong> - Published "The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws
                    of the Universe," considered one of his best books.</li>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> - Received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 2008.</li>
                <li><strong>2020</strong> - Was awarded one half of the <u>Nobel Prize in Physics</u> for the
                    discovery that
                    black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity,
                    a half-share also going to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for the discovery
                    of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.</li>
